        <h2>The Story of Moosey and Friends</h2>
        <p>
          It all started when I was a young lad, at my grandparent’s house.
          I was gifted a stuffed animal moose, which I aptly named <strong>Moosey</strong>.
          I cherished it and kept it for years, until, somehow, I had gathered
          12 friends for it. With 13 stuffed moose in my possession, I thought,
          “Why not just officially start a collection?”
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, it began. I labeled the 13 I had as founders, then every
          thrift store trip and every birthday or Christmas gift made it grow.
          Each one got a name and a number in the order I got it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I kept going until about 2021, when with my 113th moose, I declared
          the collection finished (then I got one more as a gift, but that doesn’t really count).
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, they live in my hometown bedroom, completely filling two
          bookshelves. While at home, every week I would put a different one on
          my desk as decoration. Now they can live on forever, immortalized in pixels.
