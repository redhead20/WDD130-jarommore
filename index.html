        “It all started when I was a young lad, at my grandparent’s house. I was gifted a stuffed animal moose, which I aptly named “Moosey”. I cherished it, kept it for years, until, somehow, I had gathered 12 friends for it. With 13 stuffed moose in my possession, I thought “why not just officially start a collection?” and with that it began. I labeled the 13 I had as founders, then every thrift store trip, every birthday or Christmas gift, it grew. Each one got a name, and numbered in order of when I got it. I kept going until about 2021, when with my 113th moose, I declared it finished (then I got one more as a gift but that doesn’t count). What do I do with them you ask? Well, currently they reside in my hometown bedroom, completely filling 2 bookshelves. While at home, every week I would put a different one on my desk as decoration. Now they may live on forever, immortalized in pixels”
